We are going to use R and in particular the [`{httr2}`](https://httr2.r-lib.org/index.html) package to interact with the Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API. In particular, we will leverage the API to answer the following questions:

* What are the departments contained in the museum?
* How many art pieces contain a shield?
