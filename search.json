We will also highlight ways to integrate a Shiny app with other services such as APIs and connections to databases since for many production-grade applications, ‚Äúit‚Äôs never just Shiny.‚Äù Throughout the workshop, students will build upon practical Shiny apps inspired by real-life projects illustrating user-interface improvements, efficient reactive programming, streamlined testing of backend and frontend components, intuitive debugging approaches, and more.\nThis workshop is for the Shiny developer who has entered this stage of their application development journey. The user is ready to learn how essential workflows, best practices, and the expanding community of Shiny-related packages can help them climb the ladder of Shiny development."

The positive impact of Shiny in data science workflows across academia and a variety of industries is well-known and growing by the year. It is quite common for an early prototype of a Shiny app to generate tremendous excitement for key stakeholders and decision makers, often leading to requests for enhancements and ultimately be included in a production pipeline or process. The road to meeting this goal is challenging, especially for data scientists and statisticians not accustomed to software development!"

Outside of his day job, Eric is passionate about connecting with and showcasing the brilliant R community in multiple ways. You may recognize his voice from the R-Podcast that he launched in 2012. Eric is also the creator of the Shiny Developer Series where he interviews authors of Shiny-related packages and practitioners developing applications, as well as sharing his own R and Shiny adventures via livestreams on his Twitch channel. In addition, Eric is a curator for the RWeekly project and co-host of the RWeekly Highlights podcast which accompanies every issue.\n\n\nTeaching Assistants\n\nTanya Cashorali is the founder of TCB Analytics, a boutique data and analytics consultancy. After graduating from Northeastern University with dual Computer Science and Biology degrees, Tanya started her career in the data-rich field of bioinformatics in the early 2000s. The next decade of Tanya‚Äôs career included more commercial use cases for data science and analytics. Tanya also hosts a world-wide community network of over 500 data enthusiasts, has helped universities launch data science programs, and is a frequent speaker at tech conferences.\n\nIan Dinnie‚Äôs background is in social science. Prior to joining RStudio‚Äôs customer success team, Ian worked for a non-profit economic and public policy consulting company based in Massachusetts, where he worked on projects primarily regarding economic impact analysis, demography, and housing policy. During his time there, he developed a shiny app that displayed enrollment projections for the state‚Äôs public universities and community colleges.\n\nAaron Jacobs biography forthcoming.

In addition, RStudio is also providing a dedicated instance of the RStudio Connect platform ((URL Forthcoming)) for hosting Shiny applications that you create and view throughout the workshop.\nTo leverage these platforms as well as other capabilities, please ensure you have the following established prior to the conference:\n\nAccounts\n\nGitHub account: You can create a GitHub account for free using the instructions provided in the Register for GitHub chapter of Jenny Bryan‚Äôs Happy Git and GitHub for the UseR. If you already have an acount, you are welcome to use it for the workshop.\nRStudio Cloud account: Visit rstudio.cloud and click the Sign Up link. Then create a Free account. If you already have an account, you do not need to create a new one.\n\n\n\nEnvironment Configuration\nIn the first session of the workshop, we will provide you with the instructions for connecting to the workshop environment within RStudio Cloud and the workshop RStudio Connect server. You can view the steps in the screencasts below, or view the written instructions.\n\nRStudio Connect Account & API KeyIntegrating RStudio Connect & RStudio Cloud\n\n\nsomething\n\n\nelse\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup and Requirements\n\nYou will need a GitHub account for key sections of this course. If you already have an account, you should be all set and no further action is needed. If you do not, creating an account is free. While version control itself is not a major focus of the course, we will discuss how certain elements can play an important role in application development and deployment. A great resource for getting a basic familiarity with Git version control is Jenny Bryan‚Äôs Happy Git and GitHub for the useR online book (also freely available).\nRStudio will provide a dedicated workspace for this course on the RStudio Cloud platform. This can be run directly from a web browser, and all system and R dependencies will be configured already. However, if you wish to use your local laptop to participate, you will need the following:\n\nR version 4.1.3 or later.\nYour preferred integrated development environment for R, such as RStudio Desktop or Visual Studio Code with the R Extension.\nThe {renv} package to manage package dependencies for the workshop.\nThe Git version control system. For installation instructions on each OS, please see the Install Git chapter from Jenny Bryan‚Äôs Happy Git and GitHub for the useR."
