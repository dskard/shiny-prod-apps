We will also highlight ways to integrate a Shiny app with other services such as APIs and connections to databases since for many production-grade applications, ‚Äúit‚Äôs never just Shiny.‚Äù Throughout the workshop, students will build upon practical Shiny apps inspired by real-life projects illustrating user-interface improvements, efficient reactive programming, streamlined testing of backend and frontend components, intuitive debugging approaches, and more.\nThis workshop is for the Shiny developer who has entered this stage of their application development journey. The user is ready to learn how essential workflows, best practices, and the expanding community of Shiny-related packages can help them climb the ladder of Shiny development."

The positive impact of Shiny in data science workflows across academia and a variety of industries is well-known and growing by the year. It is quite common for an early prototype of a Shiny app to generate tremendous excitement for key stakeholders and decision makers, often leading to requests for enhancements and ultimately be included in a production pipeline or process. The road to meeting this goal is challenging, especially for data scientists and statisticians not accustomed to software development!"

    "text": "Logistics\nEach day of the workshop will start at 9 AM and end at 5 PM, with multiple coffee breaks and a lunch break throughout. I will be presenting the majority of the content, but we have an amazing collection of five teaching assistants ready to assist with any technical issues or questions. All materials for the course will be viewable online at shinyprod.com and hosted on GitHub at github.com/rstudio-conf-2022/shiny-prod-apps. We also have a discussion board within the GitHub repository available for collaboration on questions and issues. Also, be aware that the workshop materials are in active development, so please check back to the site and GitHub repository regularly before the workshop. We plan on sending additional emails as we get closer to the workshop dates.\n\n\nAssumptions\nThis workshop assumes you have intermediate knowledge of Shiny application development. Specifically, that you have familiarity with the concepts of reactivity and binding inputs to outputs. If you consider yourself a beginner with Shiny, the material in this workshop may be difficult to follow during the two days. If you intended to enroll in a workshop geared towards an introduction to Shiny, please contact RStudio to see if you can switch to the Getting Started with Shiny workshop led by Colin Rundel.\n\n\nSetup and Requirements\n\nYou will need a GitHub account for key sections of this course. If you already have an account, you should be all set and no further action is needed. If you do not, creating an account is free. While version control itself is not a major focus of the course, we will discuss how certain elements can play an important role in application development and deployment. A great resource for getting a basic familiarity with Git version control is Jenny Bryan‚Äôs Happy Git and GitHub for the useR online book (also freely available).\nRStudio will provide a dedicated workspace for this course on the RStudio Cloud platform. This can be run directly from a web browser, and all system and R dependencies will be configured already. However, if you wish to use your local laptop to participate, you will need the following:\n\nR version 4.1.3 or later.\nYour preferred integrated development environment for R, such as RStudio Desktop or Visual Studio Code with the R Extension.\nThe {renv} package to manage package dependencies for the workshop.\nThe Git version control system. For installation instructions on each OS, please see the Install Git chapter from Jenny Bryan‚Äôs Happy Git and GitHub for the useR."
