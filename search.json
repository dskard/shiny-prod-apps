We will also highlight ways to integrate a Shiny app with other services such as APIs and connections to databases since for many production-grade applications, ‚Äúit‚Äôs never just Shiny.‚Äù Throughout the workshop, students will build upon practical Shiny apps inspired by real-life projects illustrating user-interface improvements, efficient reactive programming, streamlined testing of backend and frontend components, intuitive debugging approaches, and more.\nThis workshop is for the Shiny developer who has entered this stage of their application development journey. The user is ready to learn how essential workflows, best practices, and the expanding community of Shiny-related packages can help them climb the ladder of Shiny development."

The positive impact of Shiny in data science workflows across academia and a variety of industries is well-known and growing by the year. It is quite common for an early prototype of a Shiny app to generate tremendous excitement for key stakeholders and decision makers, often leading to requests for enhancements and ultimately be included in a production pipeline or process. The road to meeting this goal is challenging, especially for data scientists and statisticians not accustomed to software development!"

Specifically, that you have basic familiarity with binding inputs to outputs and application layout. If you consider yourself a beginner with Shiny, the material in this workshop may be difficult to follow during the two days. If you intended to enroll in a workshop geared towards an introduction to Shiny, please contact RStudio to see if you can switch to the Getting Started with Shiny workshop led by Colin Rundel.\nAlthough Shiny is certainly the main focus of this workshop, we will be leveraging other capabilities of R in the materials and example applications:\n\nWe will be using packages from the tidyverse to assist with data munging and processing. The majority of example code and exercises will provide the necessary code, but if you wish to make modifications we recommend R for Data Science as a great reference for becoming familiar with the tidyverse.\nIn certain situations the Shiny applications we create will leverage APIs deployed via the {plumber} package. You won‚Äôt be expected to create APIs from scratch in the workshop, but you are welcome to visit the package website to learn more about how APIs are created with plumber. To invoke the APIs from Shiny, we will leverage the {httr2} package."

While RStudio Cloud is the preferred development environment, you may utilize your local installation of R and RStudio if you prefer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio Connect\n\n\n\n\n\nView screenshots in full screen\n\n\nCreate an account on the workshop RStudio Connect server by visiting ((URL Forthcoming)) and clicking the login link in the upper right corner.\nYou will see a window that asks for either an email/password or to use a GitHub account. Please choose the GitHub option and follow the instructions to authorize RStudio Connect to your GitHub account.\nYou should now be logged in to RStudio Connect. Please create an API key for your account by following the RStudio Connect User Guide instructions on creasting an API key. Save it to a secure place as you will need it for account integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio Cloud\n\n\n\n\n\nView screenshots in full screen\n\n\nJoin the RStudio Cloud Workspace dedicated to this workshop by visiting this URL: ((URL Forthcoming)). If you already have an RStudio Cloud account, you are welcome to use it for the workshop. Otherwise, you can create a new account for free.\nYou will see a project called shiny-prod-apps. Open that project and create a saved copy. This process could take a couple of minutes depending on server load.\nAfter the project loads, you will see messages in the R console about restoring or repairing the package library. Execute renv::restore(prompt = FALSE) to install packages into the project. This process should complete in one or two minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal R & RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you prefer to use a local installation of R and RStudio, ensure you setup meets the following requirements:\n\nR version 4.1 or later\nLatest released version of RStudio, v2022.07.0-548 or later\nThe {renv} package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccount Integration\n\n\n\n\n\nView screenshots in full screen\n\n\nNavigate back to your RStudio Project created earlier. Create a new file called .Renviron withing your project directory by running the following in the R Console: usethis::edit_r_environ(scope = \"project\")\nInside the .Renviron file, add the RStudio Connect URL and your account API key using the following format (substitute values as appropriate)\n\nCONNECT_SERVER=server-address\nCONNECT_API_KEY=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n\nLink your RStudio Connect account to RStudio by going to Tools -> Global Options -> Publishing and click Connect to follow the prompts.\nRestart your R session by going to Session -> Restart R inside RStudio. Verify that your environment variables were successfully registered by printing them into your R console with the following commands:\n\nSys.getenv(\"CONNECT_SERVER\")\nSys.getenv(\"CONNECT_API_KEY\")"
